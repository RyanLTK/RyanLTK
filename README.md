- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RyanLTK
- I am a 21 y/o electrical engineer. Specifically, I do industrial automation projects, so my work is very broad from hardware, software, and system management.
- My background in computer science and software is very weak, so I spend a lot of time learning new things.
- I will be posting here when I am working on something new to get some feedback, tips, and maybe help someone else out in the future.
